## 📊 **Audit Trail**

All PIN management actions are logged including:

- When it happened (timestamp)
- Which user was affected
- IP address of admin

## 🎯 **Perfect For:**

- **Retail environments** where staff need PIN-protected settings
- **Multi-user websites** with individual user controls
- **Security-conscious applications** requiring access control
- **Administrative oversight** of user access management

## 🚀 **Ready to Use!**

The feature is now fully installed and active. Visit any user profile in your WordPress admin to see the new PIN management section!

**Next Steps:**
1. Go to **Users → All Users** to see the new PIN Status column
2. Edit any user to see the full PIN management interface
3. Test the functionality with a test user
4. Your users can continue setting/using their PINs as normal

The system integrates seamlessly with your existing PIN protection - users set their PINs in retail settings, and you manage them from user profiles. Best of both worlds! 🎉
