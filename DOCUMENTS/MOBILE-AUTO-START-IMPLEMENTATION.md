# Mobile Camera Control - UPDATED IMPLEMENTATION

## ⚠️ UPDATE: Auto-Start Replaced with Toggle Button

**Due to browser security restrictions**, the auto-start functionality has been replaced with a more user-friendly toggle button solution.

### Previous Approach (Removed)
- Auto-started camera on mobile devices
- Hidden start button
- **Issue**: Browser security warnings and permission conflicts

### New Approach (Implemented)
- Toggle button in retail header
- Manual control with clear visual feedback
- No security issues

## Current Implementation

### Camera Toggle Button
Located in the retail mode header (bottom of screen):
- Single button for start/stop control
- Clear visual states (white=off, red=on)
- Works on all devices without security issues

### Benefits of New Approach
1. **No Security Warnings** - User initiates camera access
2. **Better Control** - Clear on/off state
3. **Consistent UX** - Same interface on all devices
4. **Professional Look** - Integrated into retail UI
