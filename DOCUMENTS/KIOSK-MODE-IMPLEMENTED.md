# ✅ Kiosk Mode Implementation Complete!

The Kiosk Mode feature has been successfully implemented in your Age Estimator plugin. Here's what was done:

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`includes/admin-settings.php`**
   - Added 3 new settings registrations for kiosk mode
   - Added kiosk mode settings UI in the Display Options tab

2. **`templates/photo-inline.php`**
   - Added kiosk data attributes to the container
   - Added kiosk display HTML element

3. **`js/photo-age-estimator-continuous.js`**
   - Added kiosk mode variables and functions
   - Integrated kiosk display/hide logic with face detection
   - Added automatic return to ad after showing results

4. **`css/age-estimator-photo.css`**
   - Added complete kiosk mode styling
   - Added responsive styles for mobile

5. **`js/admin.js`**
   - Added kiosk mode toggle functionality
   - Added WordPress media uploader integration

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **No Face Detected**: Shows your advertisement image
2. **Face Detected**: Automatically hides ad and shows camera
3. **Age Displayed**: Shows age estimation result
4. **Timer**: After configured time (default 5 seconds), returns to ad
5. **Repeat**: Continues monitoring for new faces

## 🚀 Usage

1. Go to **WordPress Admin > Age Estimator > Settings > Display Options**
2. Scroll down to **Kiosk Mode Settings**
3. Check **Enable Kiosk Mode**
4. Upload or enter URL for your advertisement image
5. Set display time (how long to show results before returning to ad)
6. Save settings

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Automatic ad display when no customers present
- ✅ Seamless transition when face detected
- ✅ Configurable result display time
- ✅ WordPress Media Library integration
- ✅ Responsive design for all devices
- ✅ Works with both Local and AWS detection modes

## 🧪 Testing

1. Enable Kiosk Mode in settings
2. Upload an advertisement image
3. Visit a page with `[age_estimator]` shortcode
4. You should see:
   - Ad displays initially
   - Ad hides when you approach camera
   - Age result shows
   - Ad returns after configured time

## 🎨 Customization

You can further customize by:
- Adjusting display time (1-60 seconds)
- Using different image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF)
- Modifying CSS for different transitions
- Adding multiple ad rotation (would require additional code)

The implementation is complete and ready to use! Perfect for retail environments to monetize idle screen time.
