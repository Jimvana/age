# Fullscreen Implementation for Age Estimator Live

## Date: January 2025

## Overview
Successfully implemented fullscreen functionality for the Age Estimator Live plugin. When the user clicks the fullscreen button, the video feed, overlay canvas, and status elements are enlarged and displayed in fullscreen mode.

## What Was Added

### 1. Fullscreen Button
- **ID**: `#age-estimator-fullscreen`
- **Position**: Top-left corner of the camera view (10px from top, 10px from left)
- **Size**: 40x40 pixels
- **Style**: Semi-transparent black background with white icon
- **Visibility**: Only shown when camera is active

### 2. Elements Displayed in Fullscreen
- **#age-estimator-photo-video**: The video feed from the camera
- **#age-estimator-photo-overlay**: The canvas overlay showing face detection boxes
- **#age-estimator-status**: The status indicator showing monitoring state

### 3. Key Features
- **Toggle Functionality**: Click button to enter/exit fullscreen
- **Icon Change**: Button shows expand icon normally, compress icon in fullscreen
- **Esc Key Support**: Users can exit fullscreen by pressing Esc
- **Auto-exit**: Fullscreen automatically exits when monitoring stops
- **Responsive Scaling**: Video and overlay properly scale to fill the screen
- **Cross-browser Support**: Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

## Implementation Details

### JavaScript Functions Added
1. `addFullscreenButton()` - Creates and adds the fullscreen button
2. `toggleFullscreen()` - Toggles between fullscreen and normal mode
3. `isFullscreen()` - Checks if currently in fullscreen
4. `enterFullscreen()` - Enters fullscreen mode
5. `exitFullscreen()` - Exits fullscreen mode
6. `updateFullscreenDimensions()` - Updates overlay dimensions in fullscreen
7. `resetDimensions()` - Resets dimensions when exiting fullscreen
8. `handleFullscreenChange()` - Handles browser fullscreen events
9. `getFullscreenIcon()` - Returns SVG for fullscreen enter icon
10. `getExitFullscreenIcon()` - Returns SVG for fullscreen exit icon

### CSS Classes Used
- `.age-estimator-fullscreen-button` - Styles the fullscreen button
- `.fullscreen-active` - Applied to container when in fullscreen mode

### Browser Compatibility
The implementation includes prefixed methods for maximum compatibility:
- Standard: `requestFullscreen()` / `exitFullscreen()`
- Webkit: `webkitRequestFullscreen()` / `webkitExitFullscreen()`
- Mozilla: `mozRequestFullScreen()` / `mozCancelFullScreen()`
- MS: `msRequestFullscreen()` / `msExitFullscreen()`

## How It Works

1. **Start Monitoring**: When the user starts camera monitoring, the fullscreen button appears
2. **Click Fullscreen**: User clicks the button to enter fullscreen mode
3. **Fullscreen View**: 
   - Video fills the entire screen
   - Overlay canvas scales to match video dimensions
   - Status indicator remains visible in top-right
   - Controls remain accessible at bottom
4. **Exit Fullscreen**: Click button again or press Esc to exit
5. **Stop Monitoring**: Stopping the camera automatically exits fullscreen

## Mobile Considerations
Based on the CSS already in place:
- Fullscreen button is hidden on mobile devices (screens < 768px)
- This is because mobile browsers handle video fullscreen differently
- The video is already optimized for mobile viewing without fullscreen

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Start the Age Estimator monitoring
2. Look for the fullscreen button in the top-left corner
3. Click it to enter fullscreen mode
4. Verify that video, overlay, and status are visible
5. Click again or press Esc to exit fullscreen

## Files Modified
- `/js/photo-age-estimator.js` - Added fullscreen functionality

## Notes
- The CSS for fullscreen styling was already present in `photo-continuous-overlay.css`
- The implementation follows the existing code patterns and style
- All functionality integrates seamlessly with the existing face tracking system
