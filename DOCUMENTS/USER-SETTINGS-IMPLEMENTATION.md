# Frontend User Settings Panel - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Added

### 1. **User Settings Class** (`/includes/user-settings/class-user-settings.php`)
- Shortcode: `[age_estimator_user_settings]`
- AJAX handlers for saving settings and validating PINs
- User meta management for personal preferences

### 2. **Frontend Interface**
- **CSS**: `/css/user-settings.css` - Responsive, modern design
- **JavaScript**: `/js/user-settings.js` - Form handling and validation

### 3. **User-Specific Settings**
- **Face Tracking Distance**: Personal sensitivity threshold (0.1-1.0)
- **Retail Mode**: Individual enable/disable with personal PIN
- **Age Gating**: Custom age thresholds per user

### 4. **Modified Core Files**
- **age-estimator.php**: 
  - Added user settings include
  - Enhanced localization with user meta
  - User-specific overrides for settings
- **photo-age-estimator-retail.js**:
  - Updated PIN validation to use user-specific PINs
  - Falls back to system PIN if no user PIN set

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **PIN Security**
   - PINs are hashed using `wp_hash_password()`
   - Validated with `wp_check_password()`
   - Never stored in plain text

2. **Access Control**
   - Only logged-in users can access settings
   - Nonce verification on all AJAX requests
   - Input validation and sanitization

## 📝 How to Use

### For Site Admins:
1. Create a new page
2. Add shortcode: `[age_estimator_user_settings]`
3. Link to it from user menu/dashboard

### For Users:
1. Visit settings page while logged in
2. Configure personal preferences
3. Save settings

### For Developers:
```javascript
// Access user settings in JS
const settings = getUserAgeEstimatorSettings();

// Validate user PIN
validateUserRetailPin(pin, callback);
```

## 🚀 Key Benefits

1. **Personalization** - Each user has their own settings
2. **Security** - Individual PINs instead of shared system PIN
3. **Flexibility** - Users can adjust sensitivity to their needs
4. **Compliance** - Better for multi-staff retail environments

## 📊 Database Storage

User settings are stored in WordPress user meta:
- `age_estimator_face_tracking_distance`
- `age_estimator_retail_mode_enabled`
- `age_estimator_retail_pin` (hashed)
- `age_estimator_age_gating_enabled`
- `age_estimator_age_gating_threshold`

## 🧪 Testing

1. Open `test-user-settings.html` in browser for testing guide
2. Check `USER-SETTINGS-README.md` for detailed documentation

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

- System still works without user settings
- Falls back to global settings if user hasn't configured
- Existing retail PIN continues to work as fallback
