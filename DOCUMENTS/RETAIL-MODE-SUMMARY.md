- Database schema for compliance logging
- AJAX handlers for real-time logging

## How to Implement

### Step 1: Add PHP Settings (5 minutes)
1. Add the PHP code to your plugin's admin settings file
2. This creates new options in WordPress admin:
   - Enable/disable Retail Mode
   - Set Challenge Age (default 25)
   - Optional PIN protection
   - Enable compliance logging

### Step 2: Update JavaScript (10 minutes)
1. Add the JavaScript code to your `photo-age-estimator.js`
2. This adds:
   - Retail mode detection
   - Alert display system
   - ID check confirmation flow
   - Basic logging to sessionStorage

### Step 3: Create Database Table (2 minutes)
1. Activate/reactivate the plugin to create the logging table
2. Or manually run the SQL to create the compliance checks table

### Step 4: Test the System
1. Enable Retail Mode in settings
2. Start monitoring
3. Test with a face - see the alert system
4. Check the compliance logs in admin

## Legal Compliance
The system is designed to:
- **ASSIST** staff with Challenge 25 compliance
- **NOT REPLACE** the legal requirement to check ID
- **DOCUMENT** that checks were prompted
- **PROVIDE** evidence of due diligence

## What Makes This Legal
