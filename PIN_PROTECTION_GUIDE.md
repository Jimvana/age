# PIN Protection Setup Guide for Age Estimator Settings

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive PIN protection system for your Age Estimator plugin that prevents unauthorized access to user settings. Here's what was added:

## Files Created

1. **`includes/class-settings-pin-protection.php`** - Main PIN protection class
2. **`js/pin-protection.js`** - Frontend JavaScript for PIN handling
3. **`css/pin-protection.css`** - Professional styling for PIN interface

## How It Works

### 1. PIN Protection Flow

- When users visit a page with the `[age_estimator_settings_enhanced]` shortcode:
  - If not logged in → Shows login form
  - If logged in but no PIN set → Shows PIN setup guide with one-time access
  - If logged in but PIN session expired → Shows PIN entry form
  - If PIN verified → Shows settings with lock button

### 2. PIN Security Features

- **Hashed Storage**: PINs are stored using WordPress password hashing
- **Session Management**: 15-minute timeout with automatic session checks
- **Visual Feedback**: Professional UI with loading states and animations
- **Auto-submission**: PIN form submits automatically when 4 digits are entered
- **Lock Feature**: Users can manually lock settings anytime

### 3. User Experience

- **Professional Interface**: Modern, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Accessibility**: High contrast mode, reduced motion support, keyboard navigation
- **Mobile Friendly**: Optimized for all device sizes
- **Clear Instructions**: Step-by-step guidance for first-time setup

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Integration Complete

The PIN protection is automatically integrated with your existing settings system. The files have been added and the main plugin file updated to load the protection class.

### 2. Testing the Protection

1. Go to a page with the `[age_estimator_settings_enhanced]` shortcode
2. If you haven't set a PIN yet, you'll see the setup guide
3. Use "One-Time Access" to reach settings
4. Navigate to "Retail Mode" section and set a 4-digit PIN
5. Save settings
6. Next visit will require PIN entry

### 3. Features Available

- **PIN Entry**: Clean, professional 4-digit PIN entry form
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Lock Settings**: Manual lock button in settings header
- **Security Status**: Visual indicator showing protection status
- **One-time Setup**: Secure first-time access for PIN configuration

## User Workflow

### First Time (No PIN Set)
1. User visits settings page
2. Sees "PIN Setup Required" screen
3. Clicks "One-Time Access to Set PIN"
4. Goes to Retail Mode section
5. Sets 4-digit PIN and saves

### Subsequent Visits
1. User visits settings page
2. Sees PIN entry form
3. Enters 4-digit PIN
4. Accesses settings with lock button available

### Session Management
- PIN session lasts 15 minutes
- Automatic checks every 5 minutes
- Session expired modal if timeout occurs
- Manual lock option always available

## Customization Options

### Modify Session Timeout
In `class-settings-pin-protection.php`, change:
```php
$session_timeout = 15 * 60; // 15 minutes
```

### Styling Customization
Edit `css/pin-protection.css` to match your theme:
- Colors and branding
- Layout adjustments
- Animation preferences

### Security Enhancements
- Two-factor authentication (ready for implementation)
- IP-based restrictions
- Failed attempt limiting

## Technical Implementation

### AJAX Endpoints
- `age_estimator_verify_settings_pin` - PIN verification
- `age_estimator_check_pin_session` - Session validation
- `age_estimator_lock_settings` - Manual lock

### Security Features
- WordPress nonce verification
- Sanitized input handling
- Secure password hashing
- Session-based access control

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Keyboard navigation support

## Testing Checklist

## Support

The PIN protection system integrates seamlessly with your existing Age Estimator plugin and uses the same PIN storage as your retail mode settings. Users must set their PIN in the retail settings section, and this same PIN protects access to all settings.

The system is designed to be:
- **Secure**: Uses WordPress security best practices
- **User-friendly**: Clear interface and guidance
- **Professional**: Modern, polished appearance
- **Accessible**: Supports various user needs
- **Maintainable**: Clean, documented code

Your users will now need to enter their PIN each time they want to access the settings panel, providing the security protection you requested.
