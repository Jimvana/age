# Canvas Banner Ad System - Installation Complete ✅

## What Changed

The banner ad system has been upgraded from DIV-based overlay to Canvas-based overlay for better integration with the camera view.

### New Files Created
- `js/canvas-banner-ad.js` - Canvas banner implementation
- `css/canvas-banner-ad.css` - Canvas banner styles  
- `canvas-banner-test.php` - Test page for canvas banner
- `CANVAS-BANNER-README.md` - This file

### Files Modified
- `templates/photo-inline.php` - Added canvas-banner-active class and debug status
- `age-estimator.php` - Added canvas banner script enqueues

### Backup Location
Your original files have been backed up to: `backup/canvas-banner-setup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`

## How It Works

1. **Canvas Overlay**: Banner is drawn directly onto a canvas element overlaying the camera view
2. **Same Logic**: Uses the same fullscreen + camera active detection as the original system
3. **Better Integration**: Canvas banner scales and positions perfectly with the video feed
4. **Click Support**: Maintains click-through functionality for banner links

## Testing

1. Go to **WordPress Admin > Settings > Canvas Banner Test**
2. Configure your banner in the Age Estimator settings
3. Start camera and enter fullscreen
4. Banner should appear as canvas overlay

## Browser Console Commands

- `debugCanvasBanner()` - Check current state
- `forceShowCanvasBanner()` - Force show banner
- `forceHideCanvasBanner()` - Force hide banner

## Features

✅ **Canvas-based rendering** for better performance
✅ **Automatic sizing** to match video dimensions  
✅ **Click-through support** for banner links
✅ **Debug mode** with visual indicators
✅ **Same trigger logic** (fullscreen + camera active)
✅ **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop
✅ **Cross-browser compatibility**

## Rollback

To rollback to the original system:
1. Restore files from the backup directory
2. Remove `canvas-banner-active` class from template
3. Remove canvas banner script enqueues from main plugin file

## Support
