# Critical Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The plugin was experiencing a PHP Fatal error:
```
PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class "AgeEstimatorComplianceEmailer" not found in compliance-email-fix.php:10
```

## Root Cause
The `compliance-email-fix.php` file was being loaded by WordPress before the Age Estimator plugin had loaded its classes. This happened because WordPress attempts to load all PHP files in plugin directories that look like they might be plugins.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Renamed the problematic file
- Renamed `compliance-email-fix.php` to `_compliance-email-fix.php.disabled`
- This prevents WordPress from automatically loading it

### 2. Added safety checks to multiple files
Added the following safety checks to prevent similar errors:
```php
// Exit if accessed directly
if (!defined('ABSPATH')) {
    exit;
}

// Check if the Age Estimator plugin is active
if (!defined('AGE_ESTIMATOR_VERSION')) {
    return;
}
```

Files protected:
- `compliance-api-bridge.php`
- `test-email-system.php`
- `enhanced-email-force-send.php`
- `_compliance-email-fix.php.disabled` (the renamed file)

### 3. Fixed the loading order issue
Modified the hooks in the compliance email fix to use:
- `plugins_loaded` action with priority 20
- Nested `init` action
- Class existence check before using `AgeEstimatorComplianceEmailer`

## Result
The critical error should now be resolved. The plugin will load without fatal errors.

## If you need the compliance email fix functionality
See the `COMPLIANCE_EMAIL_FIX_README.md` file for instructions on how to properly include the fix.
